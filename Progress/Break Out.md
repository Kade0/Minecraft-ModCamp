    * Then, Change block hardness to 2 (how long it takes to be mined), resistance to 30 (how likely it is to be destroyed by an explosion) and the tool able to destroy it to a pickaxe. 
    * Make sure to skip the next few steps until you are at the Block spawning/generation properties.
    * Set the Dimensions to generate in to Surface and Blocks this ore can replace to Blocks STONE. This allows stone blocks to be replaced by your block, and also generates your block on the surface randomly.

     * Click the green plus, adding a new block. Name it "Loot_Block", and give it the lootblock texture from the Premade Textures folder. Add it to your mod creative tab, give it a hardness of -1, resistance of 200, and make it unbreakable. Leave everything else default except for the Enable Tile Entity and Inventory box.

     * Click to add an output slot. Leave settings default and put it anywhere. Save element!
     * Lets get some random number generation in here! Click Global Variables on the left side under the resources tab, and give it the name "Loot_Block_RND" and set the type to number. Click back to workspace.
     * Open the loot block element and go to the scripts page. Add a script for "On block right clicked"
     * Click on player procedures and drag out the block "open GUI for the provided player. Select the Loot Block GUI and save.
     * Open the loot block GUI element and find the Click Me! Buttom component in the menu on the right hand side. Double click on it and add a script when clicked. The final script should look exactly like what is on the Loot Block Script image in the Camp Help Folder. (This is the hardest part!)
     * Open back up the GUI Element and double click the Click Me! Component. Make sure the script is attatched to the event or it won't work!
   * ### Test it out!
   * ## Biomes (Slime Biome!)
     * Click the green plus and select biome from the list. Give it the name "Slime_Biome". On the strange tree diagram, set the ground block and underground block to a slime block NOT the slime ooze we made. Check Generate Lakes and click next.
     * Set the trees, grass and vanilla flowers per chunk to 0. 
     * Give it a biome weight of 1024, to increase the spawn chance. Click spawn none for entities and add on spawn entities and find the slime from the list. Save Element. Test it out!
   * ## Dimensions (Biomes v2)
     * Click the green plus (for the last time :( at least during this camp) and select dimension. Give it the name "Slime_World". Next, click the green plus next to biomes and select the slime biome we made. 
     * Use world gen type normal world gen. Main filler block will be slime block, secondary will also be the slime block. Leave tertiary blank! Check off fog, skylight, player can respawn, and enable weather boxes.
     * On the next page, we will see the portal creator. We are not going to use this for right now, if you would like to add it, you can go back after we test it. Uncheck the enable portal option and click next page.
     * There will be no procedures and click save.
     * Make sure to highlight the slime world by clicking on it and click edit code (under the trashcan) and click the top option.
     * Here's the Java code! Scroll down untill you see "public static int DIMID = ". The number after the = is the ID of your dimension! It will most likely be 3 or 4. Remember this number.
     * Go back to the workspace and click the green plus to create an item named "Slime_World_Teleporter", import and add the slime_ball texture from the Premade Textures file. Set the tab to our creative mod tab. On the procedure page, add a procedure for when right clicked in the air. From player procedures, drag out a "switch dimension for provided entity" and et the number to the one you remembered from the Java code. Save the mod element twice.
   * ## TEST IT OUT!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
